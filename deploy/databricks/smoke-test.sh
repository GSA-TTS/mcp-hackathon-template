# Smoke-test a deployed Databricks Apps MCP server.
#
# IMPORTANT: Databricks Apps sit behind the workspace's OAuth/SSO by default, so
# an unauthenticated curl to /health or /mcp will usually get a 302 redirect to
# a login page or a 401 — that is EXPECTED, not a server failure. To hit the app
# programmatically you must send a bearer token.
#
# Usage:
#   # Unauthenticated reachability check (expects 302/401 for a private app):
#   bash deploy/databricks/smoke-test.sh https://<app-url>
#
#   # Authenticated check (recommended) — pass a token that can access the app:
#   DATABRICKS_TOKEN="$(databricks auth token --output json | jq -r .access_token)" \
#     bash deploy/databricks/smoke-test.sh https://<app-url>
